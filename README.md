# VBA Challenge Analysis 

### Overview of Project
  The purpose of this analysis is to be able to easily determine how stocks have performed in 2017 and 2018. The challenge is to take our code that we have created throughout the module and see if we are able to refactor the code to make it more efficient. Refactoring code is a practice that helps analysts be able to alter code used for data so that it can save time, and even potentially be more presentable. This is a common practice in the data industry and therefore we should get as much exposure as we can. 

### Results
  The results in timing showed that the refactored code was more efficient in regards to the amount of time it took to process the analysis. While it may have been milliseconds faster, as it would handle larger amounts of data, it would be able to factor through them at a much more efficient pace. With the code we can also determine that 2017 was a significantly better year of performance for the stocks we are analyzing. In 2018 we see that all stocks took quite the drop aside from two, both of which were also positive in 2017.  Below are screenshots of the difference in performance between the old code and the new code as well as the stock comparison between 2017 and 2018.

### Summary
  In conclusion, refactoring code can be a huge benefit in regard to data analysis. With the ability to use existing code and improve upon it, we can tailor the code to the dataset and create a more efficient analysis process. This will save time in getting results while providing a great visualization of data to be reviewed. With every benefit there is also a downfall that can be see with refactoring code. There is additional time spent refactoring a code that already the necessary analysis so this would take away from potentially address other concerns. There is also a trial-and-error aspect of it as we need to make sure it is reading the data correctly as we make changes, another step that can cause delays.
    For the current VBA code that this challenged had us refactor, it was provided a more efficient performace however only by a small margin. It required us to create a longer code on something that was already performing well. I can see how this code would be useful if we were reviewing a larger data set as in the computing world, each milisecond does count.
